# BMI-calculator
BMI calculator developed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this project I used Ajax to get a database from another server, accessing an external API with "XMLHttpRequest".

## What is it?
Web application developed to nutritionists, enabling to save the data of patients and calculating their BMI.

## How does it work?
This web application is a single page capable of managing patients. Here you can insert new patients, delete and search patients simply and quickly. It's also possible to get a patient list from another server. The validation of the form was constructed carefully, informing about the errors that occurred in the process.
